            ## How Wealth Transfer Works in Markets
            
            This application simulates how wealth gets transferred from retail to institutional investors through market timing advantages.
            
            ### The Three-Phase Cycle:
            
            1. **Accumulation Phase**
               - Institutional investors quietly buy shares
               - Prices rise gradually, avoiding attention
               - Retail investors largely unaware
            
            2. **Markup Phase (Pump)**
               - Prices rise more rapidly
               - Media coverage and social buzz increase
               - Retail investors experience FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out)
               - Retail buying accelerates near price peaks
            
            3. **Distribution Phase (Dump)**
               - Institutional investors begin selling shares
               - Selling occurs into retail buying demand
               - Retail investors continue buying as prices peak
               - After distribution, prices fall, leaving retail investors with losses
            
            ### Wealth Transfer Mechanics
            
            The simulation tracks specifically:
            - When institutions sell to retail at market peaks
            - How much retail investors lose after buying during distribution phases
            - Cumulative wealth transfer from retail to institutional investors

            ### Key Metrics Tracked:
            1. **Direct Wealth Transfer** - When institutions sell directly to retail
            2. **Value Decay** - How much value retail purchases lose after institutional exit
            3. **Distribution Detection** - Identification of institutional selling phases
            4. **Return Differential** - How returns differ between investor classes
